# 📊 Hypothesis Testing Case Study – Basic Statistics in Action

This project explores **statistical hypothesis testing** methods using real-world datasets. We apply common statistical techniques like **t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests** to derive actionable insights for business decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Understand customer behavior, product sales, or treatment outcomes using statistical tests.
- Apply and interpret **t-tests**, **ANOVA**, and **Chi-square tests**.
- Translate statistical findings into **data-driven business strategies**.

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `LoansData.csv` – Customer loan applications and outcomes
- `Films.csv` – Movie production, genres, and performance data
- `Price_Quotes.csv` – Vendor pricing quotes
- `Priority_Assessment.csv` – Ratings and priority categorizations
- `Treatment_Facility.csv` – Health/treatment-related facility data

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- ✅ **One-sample t-test**: Compare sample mean to a known value.
- ✅ **Two-sample t-test**: Compare means of two independent groups.
- ✅ **Paired t-test**: Analyze before-and-after effects in the same group.
- ✅ **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Test differences among multiple groups.
- ✅ **Chi-square Test**: Examine relationships between categorical variables.

## 📈 Insights & Interpretations

- **T-tests** helped validate whether customer average spending differed by gender.
- **ANOVA** showed if spending habits varied across different age groups.
- **Chi-square tests** uncovered associations between payment methods and purchase categories.

Each test is accompanied by visualizations (boxplots, bar charts) and business-friendly explanations.
